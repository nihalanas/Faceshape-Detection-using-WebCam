# Faceshape Detection using WebCam
 A lightly trained face shape detection model with a accuracy of 60% yielding the use of PyTorch to build it's neural network, which can detect face in the webcam coverage and predict the shape of the face from the 5 classes it was trained on. There are three models, One which predicts shapes one a input image, one which predicts live from the webcam, one which predicts from the frame that we want from the webcam coverage.
